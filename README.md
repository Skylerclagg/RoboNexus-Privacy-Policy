# Privacy Policy
Skyler Clagg built Robotics Nexus (RoboNexus) as a free, open-source app. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use the Service.

By using RoboNexus, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. Any information collected is used solely for providing and improving the Service and will not be shared with anyone except as described below.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain information. The types of data collected are described below.

Push Notifications

If you choose to enable push notifications, the app collects your device's push notification token (a unique identifier assigned by Apple or Google to your device) and stores it on our servers (Firebase Firestore) along with your selected favorite teams and notification preferences. This data is used solely to deliver match result and schedule notifications for teams you have chosen to follow. Your push token is not linked to your identity and is not shared with any third parties. You may disable push notifications at any time through your device settings or within the app, which will remove your data from our servers.

Location Data

The app may request access to your device's location to show nearby events and venues. Location data is processed on your device only and is not transmitted to or stored on our servers.

Analytics

I use Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google, to collect anonymous usage data such as app launches, screen views, device type, and operating system version. This data is not linked to your identity and is used solely to understand how the app is used and to improve the Service. No advertising identifiers are collected. You can learn more about how Google uses data at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in the case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Cookies

The native mobile app does not use cookies. The web version of the Service may use cookies or similar technologies as part of standard web functionality. Third-party services used by the app, such as Firebase, may use cookies on the web version to collect anonymous usage data.

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate our Service;
*   To provide the Service on our behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children’s Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2026-2-25.
